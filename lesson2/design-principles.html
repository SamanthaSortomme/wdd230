            <p>Costco takes full advantage of proximity. Grouping like things together you can easily navigate between
                their featured ads, things they think you will like based on your purchases, your location, and a
                general search. The groups are far enough apart to see a clear separation, yet close enough together
                that you don't need to scroll to find them.

            <img class="card-img" src="images\WDD230Godiva.png" alt="Godiva image">

            <p>Godiva has beautiful contrast on their web page. The black and white theme contrasts with the bold gold
                which reflects their products as well as the elegance their brand likes to radiate. They have enough of
                the gold throughout that you get a warm feel on their page, but it still stands out where it is needed
                and highlights the box of chocolate that practically screams buy me now, but in a calm and sophisticated
                voice.

            <img class="card-img" src="images\WDD230Robert.png" alt="Robert Boyd">

            <p>The white space and clean design used on Robert Boyd's website is an excellent example of how to keep a
                page simple. There is enough content on the page that you don't have to look for it, and the negative
                space
                provided gives a clean feel. This is a web page designed to sell art, and the categories are clearly
                visible to the used. This makes sure that you can find what you are looking for, or browse to your
                hearts
                delight.
