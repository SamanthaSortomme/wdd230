            <h1> Welcome to the target audience page
            </h1>


            <p1>
                Our target audience will be men and women who run a business, as well as people who have the means to
                buy from
                businesses. We will focus on people in their late 20's to late 60's as those are the people with the
                most spending power and most likely to start or run a shop. <br>
                We will want them to be living in Candy Land but vendors that come for show as well as visitors will be
                sought after too. <br>
                We will be looking for people passionate about supporting local
            </p1>
